Welcome to Mind, by Kimball Bradford! This privacy policy is quite simple, as data security is a big focus in this app. By default, no data is stored off of your device, and all data on your device is encrypted, save for a small amount of metadata (Specifically the names of your journals, the number of entries, and encryption checking strings). The app will request access to read and write external files if you use the journal export feature, as the app must be able to output your journal to a file in your downloads.
